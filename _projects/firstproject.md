## Overview
This project explores how the NBA’s new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) will affect roster construction. With new financial penalties for high-spending teams, franchises are starting to prioritize roster depth over assembling multiple superstars.

## Features
- Predictive model to estimate how the CBA affects future salary allocations
- Analysis of teams like the 2024 Timberwolves that succeed through depth
- Comparison to past “superteam” models like the 2017 Warriors or Boston’s Big 3

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Data scraping or use of NBA API
- Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit 
- GitHub for version control
